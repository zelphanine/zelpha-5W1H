Finally winning against anxiety and fear since 8 days now.

About myself:
As a curious programmer, I thrive on the edge of unconventional problem-solving, continuously seeking new ways to test the limits of my intellect. The realms of mathematics and physics, mainly differential equations, multivariable calculus, electrodynamics, and fluid dynamics, hold a special place in my heart. They kindle an electrifying rush within my mind that fuels my passion. My philosophy revolves around an intuitive approach, fearlessly embracing risks and investing my utmost effort in the pursuit of my goals, dreams, and the captivating fantasies that dance through my thoughts. I am moslty educated through exploration and self learning, and most importantly, by playing around with the things which have captivated my mind. The endless resources I find around myself and the self faith I have gained from certain people I am grateful towards are not going not allow me to give up anytime soon and will always keep the fire within me alive.

Feel free to reach out to me to do anything that will make us walk on the edge and connect the dots in the head even more strongly. I am open to do any sorts of physics simulations, implementation of mathematical ideas, build awesome websites, train ai models, or just have a nice chill conversations about all the things mentioned above.
